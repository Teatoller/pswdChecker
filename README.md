Question 1: Password checker

Context

A website requires the users to input username and password to register. 

Task
Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.

Criteria
Following are the criteria for checking the password:

1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
4. At least 1 character from [$#@]
5. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
6. Maximum length of transaction password: 12

Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will 
check them according to the above criteria.
Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.

Example

If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
e.g ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345

Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1
